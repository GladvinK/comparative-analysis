In this project I addressed the challenge of distinguishing between authentic and machine-generated Amazon reviews using a dataset of 40,000 entries. By employing NLP techniques and Python libraries (pandas, numpy, re, spacy), I cleaned and preprocessed the data, excluding sentences that end with a preposition and including sentences that end with punctuations. I transformed reviews into numerical vectors using sentence embeddings and evaluated four machine learning models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM) based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score and ROC Curve. The SVM model proved to be the most effective, underscoring the difficulty of detecting machine-generated reviews and the importance of authenticity. This research provides valuable insights for businesses, recommending the SVM model for real-time review authenticity analysis.
